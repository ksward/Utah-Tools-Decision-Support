The tests in this package are JUnit tests that are run from
AllDatabaseTests.java - this class uses a global setup to handle
turning on and off the database server and makes it possible to
run these tests in reasonable time.

The tests for glucose and patient object addition and deletion are
located here because of need for access to certain DAO objects
that I have not been able to completely dissociate from this root.
My goal is that all tests relating to patients will be in the
objects.core and all tests relating to glucose decisions will be
in the glucose.objects.rules plugin.
