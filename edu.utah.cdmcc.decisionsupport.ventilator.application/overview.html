<title>Pediatric Ventilator Decision Support Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
The Pediatric Ventilator Decision Support Tool is a program
to provide decision support in the intensive care unit setting
for expert clinicians.  The goal of this tool is to provide
extremely explicit advice, so that two identical patients who have
identical physiological states will receive the same care.
<p>
The author has been inspired by the work of Drs. Alan Morris, Dean Sorenson,
and Homer Warner.  However, this work is entirely independent of these
individuals.  The primary author of the decision algorithms is Dr. Christopher Newth,
and major contributions are also being made by Dr. Kathy Sward.
