<h1>Archiving Records</h1>
Discusses how to archive patients.  The purpose of this concept is to filter out
patients who are discharged from the ICU, but remain in the database.  By setting
an archive bit, then it will be possible to put filters on the views of patients and
decisions.  The export facility may also refer to the archive flag to determine
which patients to export.  (Not certain).
