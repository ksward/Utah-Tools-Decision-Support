<h1>Editing Patient Information</h1>
Editing an existing patient.  Explains that even though the user is editing the patient,
previously derived decisions are already stored with previous values for the patient.  This
will make sense if explained properly, but for example, if the wrong weight was in the system
for earlier decisions, the decisions were still correct, given the specified weight.  This is
critical because we need to know if the computer program is creating the wrong decisions because
of user error (weight entry) or incorrect logic (bad rules).
